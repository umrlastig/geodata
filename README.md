# Geodata knowledge graph

Knowledge graph (core structure and instances) where nodes are :
- different digital assets based on geodata and relevant for research, education and open science : datasources, datasets, processes, maps, storymaps, other pedagogic materials, particularly located collections.
- catalogues organising these nodes
- user-oriented concepts that can be used to query the catalogues
