# Geodata knowledge graph

This is a combined set of classes, properties and instances, altogether designed as knowledge graph dedicated to support geodata-driven knowledge production and transfer, i.e. science and education. It can be seen as a catalogue of assets -datasources, datasets, processes, maps, storymaps, other pedagogic materials, particularly located collections- and a general property that connect any asset to user-oriented concepts that can be used to express user queries, that will be reformulated into catalogue queries.
